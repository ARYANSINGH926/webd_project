# Art Gallery

This project is a **simple HTML-only art gallery** created as part of an assignment. The gallery showcases at least 5 artworks using only HTML elements, without any CSS or JavaScript.

## Project Objective

* Create a single HTML file named **`art_gallery.html`**.
* Display at least 5 artworks (paintings, photographs, or digital art).
* Use only HTML — no CSS or JavaScript.

## Features

* Clean HTML5 structure.
* Uses `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for each artwork.
* Includes 5 artworks with captions (titles, artists, and descriptions).
* Placeholder images are used (replace them with actual artwork images).

## Files

* **`art_gallery.html`** → The main HTML file containing the art gallery.
* **`README.md`** → Project documentation.

## How to Use

1. Open `art_gallery.html` in any web browser.
2. View the artworks displayed in a simple table-based layout.
3. Replace the placeholder image URLs (`https://via.placeholder.com/...`) with real image links or local image files.

## Example Artworks Used

* *The Starry Night* — Vincent van Gogh
* *Mona Lisa* — Leonardo da Vinci
* *The Scream* — Edvard Munch
* *Girl with a Pearl Earring* — Johannes Vermeer
* *The Persistence of Memory* — Salvador Dalí

## Notes

* This project is intentionally minimal to follow the **HTML-only restriction**.
* You can expand it later with CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity.
